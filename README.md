## About
SprayCash app is an event funding app where party guest can ultimately fund the host without hassle in a gamification manner digitally without the problem of currency abuse, thereby having that same physical spraying of cash pleasure. Because `Nanwo Lagbo` (spraying of cash at events) is native to nigerian culture which is now being drastically abused, we intend to preserve that culture for generations to come by digitalizing the idea and using our technical prowess to make the culture stand, and more fun and available to the world so it can be respected and appreciated, you know!. its time we spice things up!. 


## Problem Statement
In Nigerian culture, `Nanwo Lagbo` (spraying of cash at events) is a cherished tradition that celebrates hosts and enhances festive atmospheres. However, this practice is increasingly abused, leading to concerns such as currency misuse, financial inefficiencies, and logistical challenges at events. Furthermore, as the world evolves digitally, this unique cultural expression risks being diminished or misunderstood globally.

There is a need for a solution that preserves the essence of `Nanwo Lagbo` while addressing its modern challenges. Such a solution would help maintain the cultural value, elevate the experience with gamification and digitalization, and ensure accessibility for a wider audience. By reimagining this tradition, we intend promote its respect and appreciation on a global scale while making it more enjoyable and hassle-free for both hosts and guests.

### Non-Functional Requirements <a name="nfr"></a>
- High Availability: Yoo!, Our system can never go down, seriously like never, hence why we prioritizing building a system that will have the bearest minimum downtime if ever, because we afford it. I mean that was what Mark also told Edward when they where building Facebook, I'm a fan of Mark and The Social Network. But how?, well for one, if you've gone through the codebase you'll notice we building an orthogonal system, a loose coupled system with the help of Dependency Injection, Interfaces and Single Responsibility Principle Pattern, to help improve the system fault tolerance as well as having a scalable infrastructure such as deploying with kubernetes with it's auto-scaling and load balancing capabilites to avoid a particular server being choked with traffic. 
- Scalability: We also prioritize this, because our system is basically about the idea of concurrent operation, its part of the reason for the programming language choice `GO` due to its supper power of handling concurrency with goroutine seamlessly without the necessary need of using event driven architecture(EDA) and the use of kubernetes for multiple pods deployment and auto-scaling when there's a spike.
- Low Latency: I mean, Obviously this is really important too, our system can be slow.
